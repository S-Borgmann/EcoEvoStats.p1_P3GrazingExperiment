## 1. Causal diagram of grazing rate

Grazing rates are produced by a variety of factors, encoded in the diagram below:

![DAG for grazing rates](./dag_hand.png){width="50%"}

We can draw this diagram using R:

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60),echo=FALSE,figures-1,fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph {
  graph [ranksep = 0.2]

  node [shape = plaintext]
    A    [label = 'Alone']
    Y    [label = 'Both']

    Lik  [label = 'Liking cats']
    Pers [label = 'Personality']
    Lon  [label = 'Loneliness']
    SEP  [label = 'Socioeconomic position', shape = box]

  edge [minlen = 2]
    A->Y

    Lik->A
    Pers->Lik
    Pers->Y

    A->Lon->Y

    SEP->A
    SEP->Y

  { rank = same; A; Y }
}
")
```

## 2. Probabilistic simulation of grazing rate values

We can begin to simulate grazing rates in our experiment using the above causal graph as follows:

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}

## Set the random seed ##
set.seed(42)

## constants ##
rep <- 3

## parameters ##

# Level 3 - Species #
B_dp <- 1.3 # Fixed D. pulex grazing rate
B_dm <- 1.7 # Fixed D. magna grazing rate

# Level 4 #
B_dp_intraC <- 1.1 # Fixed D. pulex intra-clonal grazing rate - I should probably modify that this depends on clone.
B_dm_intraC <- 1.5 # Fixed D. magna intra-clonal grazing rate - I should probably modify that this depends on clone.

d1 <- 0.2 # Fixed D. pulex among-clonal variance in grazing rate
d2 <- 0.2 # Fixed D. magna among-clonal variance in grazing rate

d3 <- 0.1 # Fixed D. pulex variance in intraspecific grazing
d5 <- 0.1 # Fixed D. magna variance in intraspecific grazing

d4 <- 0.1 # Fixed D. pulex variance in interspecific grazing with D. magna
d6 <- 0.1 # Fixed D. magna variance in interspecific grazing with D. pulex


# Level 5 - Meso #
dp_intraS <- 1.2 # Center of D. pulex intraspecifc grazing rate
dm_intraS <- 1.6 # Center of D. magna intraspecifc grazing rate
dp_interS <- 0.8 # Center of D. pulex interspecific grazing rate with D. magna
dm_interS <- 1.68 # Center of D. magna interspecific grazing rate with D. pulex

```

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60),eval=FALSE}
## grazing rates ##
## Note these are backwards and don't work. Paste in from function below ##
## I retain this here because its the order needed for a Bayesian model ##

g <- rnorm(rep,g_s,delta_c) # rep is the number of replicates per treatment

g_s <- B1*Spec + B2*(1-Spec) # B1 is the D. pulex grazing rate center, B2 is the D. magna grazing rate center. Spec takes a value of 1 for Dp and 0 for Dm.

delta_c <- d1*Spec + d2*(1-Spec) # d1 is the Dp among-clone variance, d2 is the Dm among-clone variance.

B1 <- B_dp*Alone + B_dp_comp*(1-Alone) # B_dp is the fixed D. pulex grazing rate center, Alone takes a value of 0 for Treatment A (when the Daphnia is in isolation) and 1 for any other treatment (when the Daphnia is in competition).

B2 <- B_dm*Alone + B_dm_comp*(1-Alone) # B_dm is the fixed D. magna grazing rate center, Alone takes a value of 0 for Treatment A (when the Daphnia is in isolation) and 1 for any other treatment (when the Daphnia is in competition).

B_dp_comp <- B_dp_intraC*IntraC + B3*(1-IntraC) # B_dp_intraC is the intra-clonal grazing rate (competition should be most intense when another individual of the same clone is present) and IntraC takes a value of 0 for Treatment B (when the Daphnia is in competition with an individual of the same clone) and a value of 1 for the other treatments.

B_dm_comp <- B_dm_intraC*IntraC + B4*(1-IntraC) # B_dm_intraC is the intra-clonal grazing rate (competition should be most intense when another individual of the same clone is present) and IntraC takes a value of 0 for Treatment B (when the Daphnia is in competition with an individual of the same clone) and a value of 1 for the other treatments.

B3 <- B_dp_intraS*Comp + B_dp_interS*(1-Comp) # B_dp_intraS is the center of the intraspecific grazing rate for D. pulex, and Comp takes a value of 0 for Treatments C,D,E. B_dp_interS is the center of the interspecific grazing rate for D. pulex against D. magna, and Comp takes a value of 1 for treatments F,G,H.

B4 <- B_dm_intraS*Comp + B_dm_interS*(1-Comp)

B_dp_intraS <- rnorm(3,dp_intraS,d3)
B_dp_interS <- rnorm(3,dp_interS,d4)
B_dm_intraS <- rnorm(3,dm_intraS,d5)
B_dm_interS <- rnorm(3,dm_interS,d6)
```

We use this logic to construct a simulation for 3x replicates of grazing rate values per focal species (Dp or Dm) X treatment (A-H).

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
## grazing rate generating function ##
g_gen <- function(rep=3,B_dp=1.3,B_dp_intraC=1.1,B_dm=1.7,B_dm_intraC=1.5,d1=0.2,d2=0.2,dp_intraS=1.2,d3=0.1,dp_interS=0.8,d4=0.1,dm_intraS=1.6,d5=0.1,dm_interS=1.68,d6=0.1,Spec,Alone,IntraC,Comp){
  
  ##Geting 3 values out of normal distribution of 'daphnia species' 'intra/interspecific' grazing rates
  B_dp_intraS <- rnorm(3,dp_intraS,d3)
  B_dp_interS <- rnorm(3,dp_interS,d4)
  B_dm_intraS <- rnorm(3,dm_intraS,d5)
  B_dm_interS <- rnorm(3,dm_interS,d6)
  
  ## Setting the grazing rates to if there is Comp 0(same species setup) or 1(different species setup) = If they would come out of coexistence or no coexistence mesocosms 
  ##!!DOES THE *COMP AND *(COMP-1) NEED TO BE SWITCHED FOR ONE SPECIES??!
  B3 <- B_dp_intraS*Comp + B_dp_interS*(1-Comp) # B_dp_intraS is the center of the intraspecific grazing rate for D. pulex, and Comp takes a value of 0 for Treatments C,D,E. B_dp_interS is the center of the interspecific grazing rate for D. pulex against D. magna, and Comp takes a value of 1 for treatments F,G,H.
  B4 <- B_dm_intraS*Comp + B_dm_interS*(1-Comp)
  
  B_dp_comp <- B_dp_intraC*IntraC + B3*(1-IntraC) # B_dp_intraC is the intra-clonal grazing rate (competition should be most intense when another individual of the same clone is present) and IntraC takes a value of 0 for Treatment B (when the Daphnia is in competition with an individual of the same clone) and a value of 1 for the other treatments.

  g_s <- B1*Spec + B2*(1-Spec) # B1 is the D. pulex grazing rate center, B2 is the D. magna grazing rate center. Spec takes a value of 1 for Dp and 0 for Dm.
  delta_c <- d1*Spec + d2*(1-Spec) # d1 is the Dp among-clone variance, d2 is the Dm among-clone variance.
  
  g <- rnorm(rep,g_s,delta_c) # rep is the number of replicates per treatment
  return(g)
}

# Try this out for Species Dp, Treatment A
Spec <- 1
Alone <- 1
IntraC <- 1
Comp <- 0
g_gen(Spec=Spec,Alone=Alone,IntraC=IntraC,Comp=Comp)
# Try this out for Species Dm, Treatment A
Spec <- 0
Alone <- 1
IntraC <- 1
Comp <- 0
g_gen(Spec=Spec,Alone=Alone,IntraC=IntraC,Comp=Comp)

g_sim <- function(focal_species,treatment){
  # Generates a grazing rate value given the treatment of the grazing rate experiment and the species of the focal clone
  if(focal_species=="Dm"){Spec <- 0}
  else if (focal_species=="Dp"){Spec <- 1}
  
  if(treatment=="A"){
    Alone <- 1
    IntraC <- 1
    Comp <- 0
  } else if(treatment=="B"){
    Alone <- 0
    IntraC <- 0
    Comp <- 0
  } else if(treatment == "C" | treatment == "D" | treatment == "E"){
    Alone <- 0
    IntraC <- 1
    Comp <- 0
  } else if(treatment == "F" | treatment == "G" | treatment == "H"){
    Alone <- 0
    IntraC <- 1
    Comp <- 1
  }
  g_gen(Spec=Spec,Alone=Alone,IntraC=IntraC,Comp=Comp)
}

g_sim(focal_species="Dm",treatment="B")
g_sim(focal_species="Dp",treatment="H")
```

## 3. Next steps

1.  Check this works properly (the embedded nature of the binary variables), both inside the g-generating function and in the function that calls the simulation.

2.  Run in a way that recreates grazing experiment data (enter a dataframe that resembles what we will produce when that data is generated from the images).

3.  Incorporate mesocosm treatment (Dp / Dm or Dp+Dm), re-run.

4.  Consider ANOVA or Bayesian model to estimate effects of treatments based on this logic.
